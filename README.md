## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm Sarita D'Sa, a data analyst from Long Island, New York. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Accounting from SUNY Plattsburgh and am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Analytics through an online program. I work for a consulting firm that services NYS Homecare Providers, where I dive deep into data to find actionable insights.

ðŸ“š What I'm Learning
I'm passionate about the world of data and am continuously expanding my skills. Right now, I'm enrolled in courses on Predictive Analytics and Management Foundations. I'm particularly interested in predictive modeling, data mining, and how data can drive better decision-making in the homecare sector. Python and SQL are my go-to tools for data analysis, and I'm always eager to learn more about machine learning techniques.

ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm exploring research projects within the homecare sector, focusing on data-driven solutions to improve patient care. I'm also working on Python assignments that involve predictive analytics techniques like multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.

ðŸŒ± Hobbies
When I'm not analyzing data, I love exploring new cuisines, spending time outdoors, and diving into a good book.
